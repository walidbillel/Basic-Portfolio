<p>My name is Walid Boubguira and I'm originally from Algeria. I moved to the U.S seeking higher education to secure a better career path.When I took some computer Application classes, I got very intersted in html language but never had the opportunity to pursue that passion </p>
<p>Nowadays any type of business needs technology and vice versa. Now, I set my vision: "become a full stack developer and conquer the world!"</p>
<p>Some of the fun facts about myself, I used to be a professional soccer player and a swimmer at the same time when I was 12 years old. </p>
