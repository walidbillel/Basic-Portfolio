<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Walid Boubguira and I'm originally from Algeria. I moved to the U.S seeking higher education to secure a better career path. Not knowing English, I had to take some classes to improve it, so I engaged into a TOEFL camp and after 6 months, I scored 84/120!</p>
<p>Upon getting a good TOFEL score, I enrolled into a computer application certificate and that's where I met html and fell in love with it. After completing the certificate, I enrolled for an MBA at Keller (Devry Graduate School). Worst decision I've ever made!!! Career service was disappointing and the only thing I ended up getting was a piece of paper saying that I have an MBA,</p>
<p>Next step, I did two internships, one was as a social media assistant and the other one as a magazine writer. I realized quickly that in the first internship, a lot of softwares were extensively used and I wanted always to know how and why those things are happening. I did my research and BOOM! programmming is the key. Now, I set my vision: "become a full stack developer and conquer the world!"</p>
