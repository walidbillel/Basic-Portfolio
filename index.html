<p>My name is Walid Boubguira and I'm originally from Algeria. I moved to the U.S seeking higher education to secure a better career path.When I took some computer Application classes, I got very intersted in The Html Language but I never had the opportunity to pursue it as a passion.</p>
<p>After living 5 years in NYC, I learned many things from life experience including professional skills aquired in my MBA journey at Devry Univeristy.  Now, I set my vision: "become a full stack developer and conquer the world!"</p>
<p>Some fun facts about myself, I used to be a professional soccer player and a swimmer at the same time when I was 12 years old. At the age of 14, I won a sliver medal in the National Swimming Competition in Algiers, The Capital of Algeria. </p>
